# Python .pyc decompilation, per-code-object recompile-equivalence

- id: `py-stdlib-recompile`
- ecosystem: python
- claim: disrobe recovers Python source whose recompiled bytecode is equivalent to the original, per code object, across the CPython 3.14 stdlib.
- measured: 95.88%
- oracle strength: strong
- CI-attested: yes [CI]
- external oracle: CPython 3.14 (recompile the recovered source, compare emitted bytecode per code object)
- reproduce: `cargo test -p disrobe-pass-py-decompile --test arbitrary_recompile_gate`
- floor: 90.00 (holds)
- gate source: crates/disrobe-pass-py-decompile/tests/arbitrary_recompile_gate.rs:34 (OBJECT_PCT_FLOOR 90.0); harness crates/disrobe-pass-py-decompile/tests/harness/py_arbitrary_measure.py over the 200-module pinned corpus; measured live 95.88 (6027 of 6286 code objects, 200 of 200 modules, whole-module exact 60.00%, 0 sibling-count collisions) on CPython 3.14 at HEAD eb2dda70 (the structurer drops the spurious break appended to a while-loop else arm whose guarded fall-through already carries the break, recovering tarfile._Stream._read)
